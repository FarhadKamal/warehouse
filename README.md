## Inventory for Tea Garden


This project keeps track of all the resources that are procured by the Tea Garden including stock maintenance, requisition, and their usage.
A Dashboard allows a user to instantly have a picture of the current state of product levels, prices, and consumption and other similar indicators.

All of these functions were carried out manually two years ago. The work before was time consuming, and unorganized to say the least. Any inquisition such as product availability would take a lengthy time to answer. This project enabled efficient and accurate track of information. It also benefitted the company by linking and referencing each stock increase and decrease with a proper document. The project avails crucial information required by the Accounts department for financial reports.
